        A bhajia is any bite-sized vegetable that has been coated in a delicious gram flour batter and then deep-fried to perfection. Also known as pakoras, these bites are very common street food found all over the Indian subcontinent and in plenty of Indian menus around the world.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>1 cup Bengal gram flour </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch asafoetida </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric </li>
        <li> teaspoon thymol seeds, or carom seeds </li>
        <li>1 medium red onion </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Mix the gram flour and all the spices with a little water at a time in a bowl, to make a thick batter, slightly thicker than pancake batter. Add salt to taste. </li>
        <li>If using cauliflower, separate the florets into bite-sized pieces. The potatoes and onions should be thinly sliced.</li>
        <li>Preheat oil and reduce the flame to medium. This will allow the bhajias to cook well both on the outside and inside. </li>
        <li>Coat the vegetables well with batter, and then deep-fry till golden.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels and serve with tamarind chutney or tomato ketchup. </li>
   
    </ol>
